This folder has been made as a spot for various scripts in order to simply the process of testing, compiling, etc.


Backend:
    Currently, there are three different ways to start the backend, with two methods being present in this folder.
    If you have maven, simply run mvn jetty:run in the root (System Prototype).
    If you have any issues with those that can't be resolved, you can use the scripts in this folder.
    The most simple is simply running the start.sh file present here which will do everything.
    If you have any issues with that, try sequentially running downloadDeps, compile, and then run.
    I have attempted to write compile .bat files for windows but I am not sure if they work yet.
    .sh files might work if you are using a non-mac unix based os but I am not sure.
    For windows machines currently run the .bat equivalents of the aforementioned files.


Encryption related:
    There are currently two scripts present in order to support testing involving encryption and decryption,
    encryptionKeyGenerator and testEncryption. You can run the latter without first running the former because it calls 
    the former anyways. DO NOT COMMIT THE .env file since this is bad practice. 
    As of current encryption has no point since the rest of the functionalities are non-existant but this supports current testing
    and hopefully allows for everyone (at least on unix) to be able to generate keys. I am not sure how to implement
    it on windows but it is not necessary for everyone to be able to play around with testing for this so it is not 
    too important.
