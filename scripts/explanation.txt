Currently only has init database since rest are no longer necessary/outdated
as of 7/17



Database:
    initDatabase initializes the entire database as it currently is
    Requires that you have the db.properties file and the user and password field match to your 
    actual credentials ie db.username="username here" and db.password="password here" 
    do not remove the other parts and keep the = because grep uses it
    unix only
