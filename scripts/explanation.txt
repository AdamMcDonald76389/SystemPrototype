This folder has been made as a spot for all scripts needed for compiling the backend as of current.
Currently, there are three different ways to start the backend, with two methods being present in this folder.
If you have maven, simply run mvn jetty:run in the root (System Prototype).
If you have any issues with those that can't be resolved, you can use the scripts in this folder.
The most simple is simply running the start.sh file present here which will do everything.
If you have any issues with that, try sequentially running downloadDeps, compile, and then run.
I have attempted to write compile .bat files for windows but I am not sure if they work yet.
.sh files might work if you are using a non-mac unix based os but I am not sure.
For windows machines currently run the .bat equivalents of the aforementioned files.
